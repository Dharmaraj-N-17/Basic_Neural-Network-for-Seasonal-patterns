# Basic_Neural-Network-for-Seasonal-patterns

This project builds a data‑driven system that predicts the next 24 hours of electricity demand using historical load patterns and calendar information like hour of day and weekday/weekend. The solution compares a simple tree‑based model with a more advanced neural network and then uses explainability techniques to show which recent hours and seasonal patterns drive each forecast, so planners can understand and trust the recommendations.
